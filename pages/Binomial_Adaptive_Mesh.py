    This example uses a *partially refined* binomial tree approach:
    - If a node's price is within a certain 'band' above the barrier, 
      we refine the tree with extra subdivisions.
    - Elsewhere, we use a normal CRR approach.
    
    **Note**: This is purely illustrative and may not be perfectly 
    arbitrage-free or recombining at boundaries. 
    It's a compromise between a standard uniform tree and 
    a fully adaptive (nonuniform) mesh.
